## **INTRODUCTION :**

I am working on a project related to privacy. 
for that i have choosen Personal Dairy project. 
Here we can keep our personal notes very safely 
because it is coming with password protected feature.
I am doing these things using C programming language
where the interface allows you to do operations like 
ADD, VIEW, DELETE, CHANGE PASSWORD, EXIT.
It can run on windows as well as linux systems in any
Versions. 

## **FEATURES :**
* It is Password Protected where no one can see our notes.
* It is efficient and doesn't require that much time to open, close and delete the notes.
* Less memory occupation.

## **TOOLS :**
   * VS Code with extentions C/C++.
   * Tested output in different platforms with tools like GitBash, Command Prompt.


## **SWOT Analysis :**

* ### **STRENGTH**
     * Internal attributes and resources that support a successful outcome.
     * Highly Secured.

* ### **WEAKNESS**
     * Password should be kept private or else it may lead to data theft.

* ### **OPPURTUNITIES**
     * This project can be used as the basis for several upcoming projects.
     * Cost Effectiveness.

* ### **THREATS**
     * Changing Technologies may cause threats.


## **4 W's and 1 H :**
    
* ### **WHO**
    * Only Authorized users can able to access Diary.

* ### **WHY**
    * It is used efficiently to prevent the data theft.

* ### **HOW**
    * It is created using functionalities such as protection.
    * optimized code results in less time consumption for running the program.
