**REQUIREMENTS :**

I am working on a project related to privacy. 
for that i have choosen Personal Dairy project. 
Here we can keep our personal notes very safely 
because it is coming with password protected feature.
I am doing these things using C programming language
where the interface allows you to do operations like 
ADD, VIEW, DELETE, CHANGE PASSWORD, EXIT.
It can run on windows as well as linux systems in any
Versions. 

**FEATURES :**
1. It is Password Protected where no one can see our notes.
2. It is efficient and doesn't require that much time to open, close and delete the notes.
3. Less memory occupation.
