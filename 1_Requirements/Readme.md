## **INTRODUCTION :**

* I am working on a project related to privacy. 
for that i have choosen Personal Dairy project. 
Here we can keep our personal notes very safely 
because it is coming with password protected feature.
I am doing these things using C programming language
where the interface allows you to do operations like 
ADD, VIEW, DELETE, CHANGE PASSWORD, EXIT.
It can run on windows as well as linux systems in any
Versions.
